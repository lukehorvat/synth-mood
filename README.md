## Setup

To run a local instance, issue the following commands:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:lukehorvat/synth-mood.git
cd synth-mood
npm install
npm start
```

This installs all dependencies and serves the Web app on port 9000.

## Contributing

Feel free to send me a pull request if you want to add your own synthesizer sounds. But please adhere to the following:

- Sounds are approximately 22 seconds in length, with 4 seconds of volume fade-in and fade-out.
- Sounds are in [Ogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg) format.
- Sounds are royalty-free.

Personally, I take the following approach to creating new sounds:

1. Craft a sound in GarageBand (or another DAW).
2. Export sound as an uncompressed WAV file.
3. [Convert WAV to Ogg using FFmpeg](/wav2ogg.sh).

At some point in the future, I will switch from using audio files to the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), in order to eliminate the long loading time.
